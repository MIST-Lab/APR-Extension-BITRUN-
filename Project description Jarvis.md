## Project description: Jarvis

[_Describe the project the best you can. Give any background information or link to resources that are necessary to understand the problem it is intended to solve. The more you elaborate on your idea, the easier it is to accomplish._]

### what:

```
This is a modern cheat-sheet to make code a more abstract concept.
```

### why:

```
Our work aims to package the complex programming details and left people more time to focus on something more important.
```

### why blockchain:

```
We want to build a low entropy system and solve three main problems:
CopyRight、Privacy、Payment
one more:  token depreciating ?!
```

### How:

```markdown
for usr Less is more. ONLY ONE CLICK	
for the engineer there are four steps to fulfill the system.
1. a code (natural language) scanner (this step is in local ENV for privacy)
2. a comprehensor to make a summary about the issue
3. a search engine/crawler go for solutions
4. a test ENV/docker to test solution
5. git touch solutionBranch + git push solutionBranch
```

## Relevant Technology

[_Write what technology is relevant. What language, what platform, any particular library/framework/existing project it is based on?_]

[blockchainAPI] **blockchain** + [A.I.API] **AI ( including machine learning and Natural Language Processing ) **+[VS code API] **VS code extension in typescript** 

## Complexity and required time

[_Please only tick off one box in each category by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`. The labels on the project will then be updated by the maintainers as soon as possible._]

### Complexity

- [ ] Beginner - This project requires no or little prior knowledge of the technolog(y|ies) specified to contribute to the project
- [x] Intermediate - The user should have some prior knowledge of the technolog(y|ies) to the point where they know how to use it, but not necessarily all the nooks and crannies of the technology
- [ ] Advanced - The project requires the user to have a good understanding of all components of the project to contribute

### Required time (ETA)

- [ ] Little work - A couple of days
- [x] Medium work - A week or two
- [ ] Much work - The project will take more than a couple of weeks and serious planning is required
